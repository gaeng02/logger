# logger
1. [Purpose](#purpose)
2. [Develop setting](#develop-environment)

## Purpose 
When working on a project, **logging** is often necessary. <br>
I realized the need for a dedicated logging library within my code. <br>
While Python provides the logging module for this purpose, my goal is to implement system-level logging without relying on external libraries.

## Develop Setting
`Python 3.12`
